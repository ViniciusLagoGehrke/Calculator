# Description

Develop a basic calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

The application should have the following features:

### 1. User Interface

[x] Design a simple and intuitive user interface for the calculator
Include buttons for:
- [x] numbers (0-9)
- [x] operators (+, -,  [ ], /) and an equal button to calculate the result
- [x] Display a text field or area to show the entered numbers and the calculated result

### 2. Basic Arithmetic Operations
- [x] Implement the functionality to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers
- [x] When the equal (=) button is pressed, the application should calculate and display the result

### 3. Error Handling
- [x] Handle basic input validation and error scenarios (e.g., division by zero, invalid input format)
- [x] Display appropriate error messages or notifications when necessary

## Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Use of our tech stack (Kotlin with Spring Boot Framework, Angular) would be nice
- [x] but you can use any programming language or framework of your choice (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.).
- [x] A server side backend would be nice but without is also ok
- [x] Employ best practices in software engineering, including modular and well-organised code
- [x] Utilise appropriate data structures and algorithms to perform the arithmetic operations
- [x] Focus on functionality rather than elaborate UI design or advanced features
