# Description

This is a basic calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

The application has the following features:

### 1. User Interface

- [x] A simple and intuitive user interface for the calculator including:
  - [x] Numbers (0-9) buttons
  - [x] Operators (+, -,  [ ], /) buttons
  - [x] Dot button to add decimals
  - [x] Change signal button to toggle between positive and negative values
  - [x] Backspace button to delete the last digit
  - [x] Clear button to reset to original
  - [x] Equal button to calculate the result
  - [x] Display a text field or area to show the entered numbers and the calculated result

### 2. Basic Arithmetic Operations
- [x] Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers
- [x] When the equal (=) button is pressed, the application calculates and display the result
- [x] When an operator button is pressed and there're already two number, the application display the result and sets the new operator

### 3. Error Handling
- [x] Handles basic input validation and error scenarios (e.g., division by zero, invalid input format)
- [x] Displays appropriate error messages or notifications when necessary

## Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Use of Kotlin with Spring Boot Framework and Angular
- [x] but you can use any programming language or framework of your choice (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.).
- [x] Next.js API to calculate all operations
- [x] An alternative server with Node.js and Express
- [x] Best practices in software engineering, including modular and well-organised code
- [x] Utilise appropriate data structures and algorithms to perform the arithmetic operations
- [x] Focus on functionality 
- [x] Elaborated UI design or advanced features
