- [x] Displays appropriate error messages or notifications when necessary

## Technical Requirements:
- [x] Use of Kotlin with Spring Boot Framework and Angular
- [x] Use of other programming languages or framework (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.)
- [x] Next.js API to calculate all operations
- [x] An alternative server with Node.js and Express
- [x] Best practices in software engineering, including modular and well-organised code
- [x] Utilise appropriate data structures and algorithms to perform the arithmetic operations
- [x] Focus on functionality
